## TypeScript configuration

To use FluxModels with TypeScript, you need to enable experimental decorators and emit decorator metadata in your `tsconfig.json` file.

Add the following configurations:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        // ... other options
    }
}
```

These settings allow TypeScript to properly handle the decorators used in FluxModels and ensure full functionality of the library.

&nbsp;

# Basic Usage (React)

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useModel } from '@fluxmodels/react'

const UserModel = {
    username: ''
}

function UsernameInput() {
    const [user, updateUser] = useModel(UserModel)

    return <input 
        value={user.username} 
        onChange={(e) => 
            updateUser({ username: e.target.value })
        } 
    />
}

function App() {
    return <UsernameInput />
}
```

&nbsp;

More complex example:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'

import { STRING } from 'metatyper'
import { useModel, OnInit, UseSuspense, getKey } from '@fluxmodels/react'
```

```jsx
class UserModel {
    id = ''
    username = STRING({ maxLength: 12, default: '' })

    async loadUserData({ userID }) {
        // Here could be your API call
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))

        const userData = {
            id: userID,
            username: 'user_' + userID
        }

        Object.assign(this, userData)
    }

    @OnInit() // calc this before render
    @UseSuspense() // will use Suspense until loaded
    async loadUser() {
        const userID = getKey(this)

        await this.loadUserData({ userID })
    }
}
```

```jsx
function UserComponent({ userID }) {
    const [user] = useModel(UserModel, { key: userID })

    return (
        <div>
            <p>ID: {user.id}</p>
            <p>Username: {user.username}</p>
            <br />
            <button onClick={() => user.loadUser()}>Load user again</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
            <UserComponent userID="1" />
            <br />
            <UserComponent userID="2" />
        </Suspense>
    )
}
```

# Documentation

## React

React package contains the React hooks and tools for FluxModels.

### useModel

The `useModel` hook is a core feature of FluxModels for React applications.
It connects React components to states, enabling reactive updates and efficient re-renders.

`useModel` takes two arguments:

1. `model`: A class or object model (see [Model](#model) for more details)
2. `args` (optional): An object with the following properties:
    - `key`: `any` - Identifier for the state in the store
    - `store`: `ModelsStore` - Custom models store (see [Models Store](#models-store))
    - `keyEqual`: `(existsKey: string, searchKey: string) => boolean` - Custom key equality function
    - `observeProps`: `ObservablePropsArgsType` - Properties to observe (see [Observable Props](#observable-properties))
    - `autoResolveObservableProps`: `boolean` - Controls automatic resolution of observable props (default: `true`)
    - `disableSuspense`: `boolean` - Disables [UseSuspense](#react-suspense-and-usesuspense) functionality if `true`

`useModel` returns a tuple, just like React's useState:

1. A frozen state snapshot (read-only version of the model state)
2. An update function

You can update the state in two ways:

1. Using the returned update function (e.g., `updateUser`)
2. Calling model actions (e.g., `user.updateUsername`)

Example:

```jsx
const UserModel = {
    username: '',
    updateUsername(newUsername) {
        this.username = newUsername
    }
}

// -------------------------------------------

const [user, updateUser] = useModel(UserModel)

// Update the model
updateUser({ username: 'Felix' })

// Or by action (model method)
user.updateUsername('Felix')
```

> Modifying this.username updates the state and triggers re-renders,
> but doesn't directly change the original model object

&nbsp;

### React Suspense and UseSuspense

React Suspense is a feature that allows you to suspend the rendering of a component until a certain condition is met.
In FluxModels, it is used to suspend the rendering of a component until an async method decorated with @UseSuspense has been resolved.

Example:

```jsx
class MyModel {
    @UseSuspense()
    async load() {
        // DO something
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    }
}

function MyComponent() {
    const [state] = useModel(MyModel)

    return <div>
        OK
        <button onClick={() => state.load()}>Load</button>
    </div>
}

function App() {
    // Loading... will be shown after the button is clicked and until state.load is resolved.

    return <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <MyComponent />
    </Suspense>
}
```

One more example:

You can use `UseSuspense` decorator with `OnInit` decorator to load data on state initialization:

```jsx
class MyModel {
    @OnInit()
    @UseSuspense()
    async load() {
        // DO something
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    }
}

function MyComponent() {
    const [state] = useModel(MyModel)

    return <div>OK</div>
}

function App() {
    // Loading... will be shown at first render and until state.load is resolved

    return <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <MyComponent />
    </Suspense>
}
```

&nbsp;

### useModelsStore and ModelsStoreProvider

The `ModelsStoreProvider` is a React component that creates a context for the ModelsStore, making it available to all child components.
The `ModelsStoreProvider` component is used to provide a shared state for a component subtree. Multiple `ModelsStoreProvider`s can be used for different subtrees, and they can even be nested.
This works similarly to React Context. If a model is used in a component tree without a `ModelsStoreProvider`,
it will use the default `ModelsStore`. This is called the provider-less mode.

`useModelsStore` is a hook that allows you to access the current `ModelsStore` within a React component. It's typically used in conjunction with the `ModelsStoreProvider` to manage and share state across your application.

Example:

```jsx
const UserComponent = () => {
    const [user] = useModel(UserModel)

    return <div>User: {user.username}</div>
}

const store = new ModelsStore()

function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <UserComponent />

            <ModelsStoreProvider store={store}>
                <UserComponent />
            </ModelsStoreProvider>
        </>
    )
}
```

&nbsp;

## Core

Core package contains the core functionality of FluxModels. It is a standalone library that can be used without React.

### Model

Model is a class or object that describes the [state](#state-and-statemanager) and state actions (methods).

It's like prototype of the state. You can create a lot of instances of the model and they will be independent.
To describe the model you need to use props with values and types from [Metatyper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metatyper).
Also you can use [Injected Models](#injected-models) to create nested states.

> Any class or object can be a model

Example:

```ts
import { NUMBER, STRING } from 'metatyper'

class UserModel {
    id = NUMBER({ min: 0, optional: true })
    username = STRING({ maxLength: 12, default: '' })
}

const UserModel2 = {
    id: NUMBER({ min: 0, optional: true }),
    username: STRING({ maxLength: 12, default: '' })
}

const userState = StateManager.createState(UserModel) 
// creates a new instance of UserModel

const userState2 = StateManager.createState(UserModel2) 
// creates a deepcopy of UserModel2
```

&nbsp;

### State and StateManager

State and StateManager are core concepts in FluxModels:

State:

- Represents an instance of a model
- Created by the StateManager
- Acts as a proxy object that:
  - Tracks changes
  - Performs validation and serialization
  - Invokes handlers (added via [@On{EventName}](#event-handling-with-eventsmanager) decorators or StateProxy mounting)

StateManager:

- Responsible for managing the lifecycle of states
- Key functionalities include:
  - Creating new states
  - Searching for existing states
  - Managing state metadata
  - Handling state operations and updates

For an in-depth look we recommend exploring the [source code](https://github.com/fluxmodels/fluxmodels/tree/main/packages/core/src/StateManager.ts).

&nbsp;

### StateProxy and StateProxyManager

The StateProxyManager is a crucial component responsible for managing the lifecycle of state proxies in FluxModels.

A StateProxy serves as a reactive wrapper around a state object, acting as a bridge between the [State](#state-and-statemanager) and view components (e.g., React components). It enables efficient, reactive data management by ensuring that when observable properties change, all associated views are re-rendered.

Key features of StateProxy:

1. Observable Property Marking: Identifies which state properties should trigger updates.
2. Re-render Management: Handles component re-renders through mount/unmount operations.
3. Snapshot Creation: Generates immutable copies of the state for side-effect-free operations.

Lifecycle of a StateProxy:

1. Creation: Typically initiated by hooks like `useModel` in React.
2. Mounting: Occurs when a view component mounts, attaching re-render functions to observable property changes.
3. Unmounting: Happens when a view component unmounts, cleaning up listeners.
4. Snapshot Creation: Can be created on-demand (e.g., returned by the `useModel` hook in React).

The StateProxyManager oversees these proxies, handling change events and managing their overall lifecycle.

&nbsp;

### Observable Properties

Observable properties are a key feature in FluxModels, allowing for fine-grained reactivity:

- They are specific state properties that the StateProxy monitors.
- Changes to observable properties emit events, triggering re-renders in associated components.
- This selective approach ensures efficient updates, re-rendering only when necessary.

Setting Observable Properties:

- Explicit Declaration: Use the `observeProps` argument (e.g., in the `useModel` hook).

```ts
import { InjectModel } from '@fluxmodels/core'

class ProfileModel {
    fullName = ''
}

class UserModel {
    username = ''
    profile = InjectModel(ProfileModel)

    passwordHash = ''
}

// -------------------------------------------

import { useModel } from '@fluxmodels/react'

const Component = () => {
    const [user, updateUser] = useModel(UserModel, {
        observeProps: { 
            username: true, 
            passwordHash: false, 
            profile: ['fullName']  // or { fullName: true }
        }
    })

    return <div>
        ...
    </div>
}
```

> You can use nested arrays or objects to observe InjectedModel properties (like `profile` in the example above).

> Also you can use false to not observe properties in any case.

- Implicit Declaration: Properties become observable when accessed via the state proxy.

```ts
const username = user.username; // 'username' is now an observable property
```

By leveraging observable properties, FluxModels provides a powerful yet flexible system for managing state updates and component re-renders, allowing developers to create highly responsive and efficient applications.

&nbsp;

### Injected Models

Creates a dynamic property that returns a state (either new or from the store).
When the property is accessed, it calls StateManager.getOrCreateState() with the provided model and arguments.

InjectModel accepts two arguments:

1. `model`: A class or object model (see [Model](#model) for more details)
2. `args` (optional): An object with the following properties:
    - `key`: `any` - Identifier for the state in the store
    - `store`: `ModelsStore` - Custom models store (see [Models Store](#models-store))
    - `keyEqual`: `(existsKey: string, searchKey: string) => boolean` - Custom key equality function
    - `observeProps`: `ObservablePropsArgsType` - Properties to observe (see [Observable Props](#observable-properties))
    - `autoResolveObservableProps`: `boolean` - Controls automatic resolution of observable props (default: `true`)
    - `disableSuspense`: `boolean` - Disables [UseSuspense](#react-suspense-and-usesuspense) functionality if `true`

> `key` accepts INJECT_KEY symbol to also inject the parent state key.

> `store` accepts INJECT_STORE symbol to also inject the parent state store.

> `model` and `args` can be functions that will be called each time the property is accessed.

Basic usage:

```ts
class UserProfile {
  name = ''
}

class UserWithProfile {
  profile = InjectModel(UserProfile)
}
```

Usage with dynamic model and key selection:

```ts
import { InjectModel } from '@fluxmodels/core'

class UserProfile {
  name = ''
}

class AdminProfile {
  name = ''
  adminRole = 'default'
}

class UserWithProfile {
  userType = 'default'

  profile = InjectModel(
    (state: UserWithProfile) => state.userType === 'admin' ? AdminProfile : UserProfile,
    (state: UserWithProfile) => ({ key: `${state.userType}:${getKey(state)}` })
  )
}
```

State management and reactivity:

```ts
import { StateManager, StateProxyManager } from '@fluxmodels/core'

const [userState] = StateManager.getOrCreateState(UserWithProfile)
const userStateProxy = StateProxyManager.createStateProxy(userState)

userStateProxy.mount(function rerender() {
  // This function will be called when userState or its injected states change
  console.log('User state updated')
})

// This is similar to a `useModel` hook in `@fluxmodels/react`
// In a React component, userStateProxy.mount would be called during component mounting
// The rerender function passed to mount will be triggered on state changes,
// causing the component to re-render and reflect the updated state

const profileState = userState.profile
profileState.name = 'John' // This will trigger the mounted function above
```

&nbsp;

### Models Store

ModelsStore is a simple storage to store states.

You can implement your own store if you don't want to use the default one.

Available methods:

- findState - find state by model and keyFindFunc
- getStates - get all states by model (and may be filtered by `keyFilterFunc`)
- addState - add state to the store
- clearStore - clear the store

> key may be any value

> keyFindFunc - function that should return true if the existsKey is target key

For more details on the implementation, see the [StateStore source code](https://github.com/fluxmodels/fluxmodels/tree/main/packages/core/src/StateStore.ts).

&nbsp;

### Event Handling with EventsManager

The EventsManager is a powerful class designed to manage events within your models, providing a streamlined approach to event handling and observation.

EventsManager supports five primary events:

1. **Init**: Triggered when a state is initialized.
2. **Change**: Fired when a state undergoes modification.
3. **Error**: Occurs when validation or serialization encounters an error.
4. **Mount**: Activated when a state proxy is mounted (e.g., when `useModel` is called in React).
5. **Unmount**: Triggered when a state proxy is unmounted (e.g., when a React component is destroyed).

Also there are same named decorators / functions, that helps to add events handlers.

OnChange:

```ts
import { OnChange } from '@fluxmodels/core'
// or import { OnChange } from '@fluxmodels/react'

class Model {
    @OnChange()
    changeHandler(args: {
        state: this
        propName: string | symbol
        prevValue: any
        newValue: any
    }) {
        // will be called when states changes
        console.log(args)
    }
}
```

OnError:

```ts
import { OnError } from '@fluxmodels/core' 
// or import { OnError } from '@fluxmodels/react'

class Model {
    @OnError()
    errorHandler(args: {
        state: any
        error: Error
        errorPlace: MetaErrorHandlerPlaceType 
        // 'get' | 'set' | 'define' | 'delete' | 'validate' | 'deserialize' | 'serialize'
    }) {
        // will be called when an error occurs 
        // while states are being changed (validation or serialization errors)
        console.log(args)
    }
}
```

OnInit:

```ts
import { OnInit } from '@fluxmodels/core'
// or import { OnInit } from '@fluxmodels/react'

class Model {
    @OnInit()
    onInit(state: this) {
        // will be called when state is initialized, e.g. when useModel is called first time
        console.log(args)
    }
}
```

OnMount / OnUnmount:

```ts
import { OnMount, OnUnmount } from '@fluxmodels/core'
// or import { OnMount, OnUnmount } from '@fluxmodels/react'

class Model {
    @OnMount()
    onMount(state: this) {
        // will be called when state is mounted, e.g. React component is mounted
        console.log(args)
    }

    @OnUnmount()
    onUnmount(state: this) {
        // will be called when state is unmounted, e.g. React component is unmounted
        console.log(args)
    }
}
```

&nbsp;

### Utils and Tools

#### UseLoader

There is special decorator `@UseLoader` that helps to handle start and end of the async actions in your models.

Example:

```ts
import { UseLoader } from '@fluxmodels/core'
// or import { UseLoader } from '@fluxmodels/react'

class MyModel {
    isLoading = false

    @UseLoader((isLoading, state) => {
        state.isLoading = isLoading
    })
    async load1() {
        // DO something
    }

        
    // or 

    setLoading(isLoading: boolean, state: this) {
        this.isLoading = isLoading
    }

    @UseLoader('setLoading')
    async load2() {
        // DO something
    }
}

```

&nbsp;

### Runtime Validation/Serialization

Models in FluxModels are closely integrated with [Metatyper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metatyper), a powerful library that enhances state management capabilities. This integration offers several key benefits:

1. Declarative and Reactive State Management: Leveraging Metatyper's functionality, FluxModels enables developers to manage and observe state in a clear, declarative, and reactive manner.

2. Automatic Validation and Serialization: Metatyper handles data validation and serialization tasks, reducing the burden on developers and ensuring data integrity.

3. Native-like State Description: Developers can define their state structure and interactions at a high level, abstracting away low-level implementation details.

This synergy between FluxModels and Metatyper allows for a more intuitive and efficient approach to state management, combining the best of both libraries to create robust and maintainable applications.

Example (React):

```ts
import { STRING } from 'metatyper'

class MyModel {
    id = 0
    username = STRING({ maxLength: 3, default: '' })

    updateUsername(newUsername) {
        this.username = newUsername 
        // throws ValidationError if newUsername.length > 3 or newUsername not string
    }
}

// -------------------------------------------

const [state, updateState] = useModel(MyModel)

updateState({ id: "some id" }) // will throw ValidationError, because id must be number
state.updateUsername('1234') // will throw ValidationError, because maxLength is 3
```

> `ValidationError` or `SerializationError` are part of the Metatyper functionality
